19/19 test cases compiled and executed correctly.
Great work!

ASSIGNMENT 2:
8/8 new test cases interpreted successfully.
8/8 new test cases compiled and executed successfully.
Register allocation and move biasing seems fine except that you only
use callee-save registers. You get full credit for this assignment,
but I very strongly suggest that you implement a solution to allow the
use of caller-save registers going forwards.
Regardless, well done.

ASSIGNMENT 3:
Please export a "typechecker" value as described in the Piazza post for this assignment.

Part of this assignment required you to move 0 to %rax at the end of
your programs, as an exit code of normal termination. I won't penalize
you further for not doing so this time but ensure you fix this for
the next assignment.

All old test cases worked correctly modulo the above issue about exit codes.

It appears that a major problem in your compiler is that it doesn't
hadle if statements well. They turn up in your printed x86, and of
course they aren't valid x86 instructions.

Also, in many programs your flattening pass doesn't work as intended
-- if there is a nested if inside the condition of the outer if, you
aren't flattening the inner if. In fact, it looks like you aren't
flattening the condition of the if in some other cases, too, like when
the condition is a (eq?)

Also note that in the r2_19 test case, the interpreter asks for input,
but none should be required -- and is a short-circuiting operator so
(and #f (eq? (read) 42)) should never ask the user for input.

Remember to submit a fixed version in one week for most of the remaining credit.

	   V compiler	     V cases that interpret 	   V partial credit for cases that worked up to flattening
Grade: (.5 * 13/23) + (.5 * (16/23 + (3/10 * 3/23) + (2/10 * 4/23))) = 67%
       	     	      	  ^ interpreter	   ^ partial credit for cases that worked up to select-instructions


ASSIGNMENT 3 (late):

You /still/ didn't add a "typechecker" value to your compiler.rkt,
which meant that I had to go in and edit it manually. We won't
penalize you for this, but please read the Piazza post for the
assignment in the future.

23/23 test cases compile and interpret correctly. Well done.

Final grade: 97%
